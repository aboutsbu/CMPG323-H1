## A File Reading Class 

This piece of code had sparked an insane amount of interest within me that I had not known existed before. 
It simply opens the provided text file, reads them into an array of objects, and stores them within those arrays. 

Later on, we serialized the objects. There isn't much problem-solving happening, however, the simple (yet initially complex) code, was what changed my perspective (at the time) about IT.
